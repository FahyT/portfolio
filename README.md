# Portfolio

## Description 

This website is to display other work I have done throughout my time as a web developer.

A link to the website can be found here: https://fahyt.github.io/portfolio/


## Installation

The project is a static webpage hosted on Github Pages so no installation is required apart from a web browser of your choice.


## Usage 

The website is a static page and is easy to use. Simply click the navigation links at the top-right of the page to be taken to an article explaining more on that topic.
